# What is this?

WedGE is Web Game Engine
That means you can use it to make games in web app in front-end javascript. (You don/t need to use it for games but thats the main purpous.)

# How to setup WedGE?

You can import it into your html app with `<script src="https://gameengine.petrprudil.repl.co/wedge.js"></script>` line. (make sure that this line is placed before `<script src="script.js"></script>` (or other scripts that you want to use WedGE in).)
Then
in your HTML file add `<canvas id="gameCanvas"></canvas>` tag (don't fergot to ad the `id="gameCanvas"` part)
and then
in your script type `wedge.setup()` this will setup wedge and link it to your game canvas.
afther this you can use WedGE in your web application. If you don't know how to use Wedge functions look at the tutorial below
